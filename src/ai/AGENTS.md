# AI Code Rules

本文件只适用于 `src/ai/` 子树。来源：`upstream/claude-code-game-studios-v1.0.0/.claude/rules/ai-code.md`。

- AI update budget: 2ms per frame maximum — profile to verify
- All AI parameters must be tunable from data files (behavior tree weights, perception ranges, timers)
- AI must be debuggable: implement visualization hooks for all AI state (paths, perception cones, decision trees)
- AI should telegraph intentions — players need time to read and react
- Prefer utility-based or behavior tree approaches over hard-coded if/else chains
- Group AI must support formation, flanking, and role assignment from data
- All AI state machines must log transitions for debugging
- Never trust AI input from the network without validation
